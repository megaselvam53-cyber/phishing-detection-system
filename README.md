# 🛡️ Phishing Website Detection System

Phishing Website Detection System is a Machine Learning based web application that detects whether a given website URL is legitimate or phishing.  
The system uses a trained ML model and a Flask web interface to classify URLs in real-time.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Phishing attacks are one of the most common cyber threats.  
This project helps identify malicious phishing websites using machine learning techniques.

The model analyzes URL-based features and predicts whether the website is:

- ✅ Legitimate
- ❌ Phishing

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (Web Framework)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- HTML (Frontend Templates)
- Machine Learning Model (.pkl)

## 📂 Project Structure

- `app.py` → Flask application (web interface)
- `model.py` → Machine learning model training script
- `model.pkl` → Trained ML model file
- `phishing.csv` → Dataset used for training
- `templates/` → HTML files for frontend
